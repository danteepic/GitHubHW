Be prepared to share:
	• What search terms did you use? Why did you use these search terms?
	• How confident did you feel about these search terms? Did you already have a clear idea of the specific roles you want or do you hope to have a better sense of that as the program progresses?
	• How many jobs did you find?
	• What did the job descriptions entail?
	• What skills and qualifications did you see frequently?
How did skills and qualifications differ between similarly titled jobs?
